# Smart Pot

The Smart Pot is a concept for an internet enabled plant pot that was developed as part of the [Internet of Things and Wireless Networks course][IoT] at [Kiel University][CAU] in summer term 2021. The Smart Pot aims at preventing the death of indoor plants by reminding their owners of watering them regularly and enabling the owner to water their plant even if they are not at home. Users can monitor the plant's health via an Android app that displays the data collected by various sensors integrated into the pot. If the soil runs dry, the plant can be watered remotely with just a click of a button. Depending on the plant's needs, the built-in water tank can hold enough water for multiple weeks of unattended operation.
